  abstract      = {We give a denotational framework (a ``meta model'') within which certain properties of models of computation can be compared. It describes concurrent processes in general terms as sets of possible behaviors. A process is determinate if, given the constraints imposed by the inputs, there are exactly one or exactly zero behaviors. Compositions of processes are processes with behaviors in the intersection of the behaviors of the component processes. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous processes have only synchronous signals as behaviors. Strict causality (in timed tag systems) and continuity (in untimed tag systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems},

The Model-of-Computation (MoC) should appropriately capture system dynamics, support analysis and synthesis, and allow low-overhead model-driven implementations. This combination poses a significant challenge. The Scenario-Aware DataFlow (SADF) MoC has been introduced to address this challenge. This paper surveys SADF, and compares dataflow MoCs in terms of their ability to capture system dynamics, their support for analysis and synthesis, and their implementation efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Data flow models are used for specifying and analysing signal processing and streaming applications. However, traditional data flow models are either not capable of expressing the dynamic aspects of modern streaming applications or they do not support relevant analysis techniques. The dynamism in modern streaming applications often originates from different modes of operation (scenarios) in which data production and consumption rates and/or execution times may differ. This paper introduces a scenario-aware generalisation of the synchronous data flow model, which uses a stochastic approach to model the order in which scenarios occur. The formally defined operational semantics of a scenario-aware data flow model implies a Markov chain, which can be analysed for both long-run average and worst-case performance metrics using existing exhaustive or simulation-based techniques. The potential of using scenario-aware data flow models for performance analysis of modern streaming applications is illustrated with an MPEG-4 decoder example},
